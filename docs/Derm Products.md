Acne face

* Adapalene: A retinoid, this active ingredient helps to clear blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples.  
* Azelaic acid: It fights acne and can also fade the dark spots that appear when an acne spot clears.  
* [Benzoyl peroxide](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/benzoyl-peroxide-faqs): This acne-fighter is especially effective at treating mild pimples. While you’ll find products that contain up to 10% benzoyl peroxide, it’s best to start with a product that contains 2.5%. That will help you avoid side effects like dry, irritated skin or a burning sensation.  
* Salicylic acid: Because it unclogs pores and exfoliates the skin, salicylic acid works best on whiteheads and blackheads.

Tips:

- Keep face hydrated with a lightweight moisturizer or moisturizing sunscreen  
- Keep face clean washing face every night and after activity Wash face every night, Use a gentle, non-ac   
- Keep your skin clean. Gently wash your face up to twice daily and after sweating. Choose a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Apply it with your fingertips, as scrubbing with washcloths, sponges, and other tools can irritate your skin.  
- When using retinoids (adapanele or tretinoin) apply a very thin layer to entire face \- maybe starting 2-3 nights per week and working your way up to nightly as tolerated  
- Shampoo regularly. The oil from your hair can cause acne on your forehead. If you have oily hair, shampoo more often than you do now and keep your hair away from your face.  
- Consistency is key. It can take weeks to months to notice fewer breakouts. Be patient can create a routine.   
- Keep your hands off. While it can be tempting to pick, pop, or squeeze your acne, doing so will make the acne take longer to clear and increase your risk for scarring and dark spots called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.  
- Stay out of the sun and tanning beds. Along with increasing your risk for skin cancer, tanning damages your skin and can worsen acne. Some acne medications can also make your skin very sensitive to damaging ultraviolet rays from the sun and tanning beds.
