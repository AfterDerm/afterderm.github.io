# Business Model & Objectives

> **See also:** `README_BUSINESS.md` for operational details, editorial standards, and day-to-day repo conventions.

## Overview
This platform provides healthcare providers with white-labeled, condition-specific product recommendation sites that bridge the gap between clinical visits and patient purchases. The business is designed as a bootstrapped lifestyle venture focusing on recurring B2B revenue.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare providers, particularly dermatologists, regularly recommend over-the-counter products during patient visits. They hand out free samples from brand representatives and provide verbal instructions on which products to continue using, how to use them, and where to purchase them. However, patients often forget specific recommendations or get overwhelmed when shopping, leading to suboptimal product selection and treatment outcomes.

Providers want their patients to have an easy, reliable resource to reference after appointments, but lack the tools to create and maintain such solutions efficiently.

## Solution
An ultra-lightweight, multi-brand, OTC-only "instruction â†’ buy" bridge that enables:
- Frictionless handoff from practice to patient (via QR codes or direct links)
- Condition-specific product recommendations with educational content
- Direct purchase links (starting with affiliate links, progressing to e-commerce)
- Customizable instructions and product selections per practice

## Target Market

### Primary: Dermatology Practices
- 12,000+ dermatologists in the US
- Average provider sees 40+ patients daily
